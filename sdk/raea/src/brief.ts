// raea/brief: what an agent writes for raea as data (docs/handoff/authoring.md, docs/projects.feature PJ0). A spec is a
// module whose default export is one of these values; it renders nothing and imports nothing that renders.
//
//   // brief.ts
//   import { brief } from "raea/brief";
//   export default brief({ title: "Spring drop", believe: "...", mode: ["pitch"] });
//
// The types are generated from the Rust schemas (core/brief, raea-core-brief) into brief.gen.ts, so what tsc checks is
// what raea reads: `raea context` evaluates the module and Rust validates its default export again.
